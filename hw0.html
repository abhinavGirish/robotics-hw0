<h1>Sensing</h1>
<p>The robot most likely uses GPS coordinates to determine its current location.</p>
<h2>Planning</h2>
<p>The robot probably utilizes computer vision to determine areas that have relatively few obstacles in its
line of sight. It then determines what direction to steer. </p>
<h3>Acting</h3>
<p>The robot most likely computes a set of waypoints (2D coordinates) for a desired location, and utilizes
inverse kinematics to figure out the desired angle configurations of the joints to move to the location. </p>
